 **Zauriel Jesus Espejel Cervantes ID:171888**   
For the assignment 1 we have to code a hanoi towers algorithm in prolog
to execute run  
`tower_of_hanoi(N)` where N is the number of rings to have.

##  Example
First we have te initial state where all the rings are in the first tower.  
![Step 1](Hanoi/Hanoi_1.png)  
Move the first disk from initial to objective tower.  
![Step 2](Hanoi/Hanoi_2.png)  
Then move the second disk to auxiliar tower.  
![Step 3](Hanoi/Hanoi_3.png)  
After that move the first one to the top of the green one.  
![Step 4](Hanoi/Hanoi_4.png)  
Finally move the blue to the objective, so now the green one have to be moved on top of the blue one.  
![Step 5](Hanoi/Hanoi_5.png)  
But the red one is distrubing the green so move it to the frist tower.  
![Step 6](Hanoi/Hanoi_6.png)
Now we can move the red one to the top of the blue one.  
![Step 7](Hanoi/Hanoi_7.png)  
And finally move the red one on top of the third tower.
